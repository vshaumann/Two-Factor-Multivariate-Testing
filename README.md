# Two-Factor-Multivariate-Testing using R

## Executive Summary

The purpose of our analysis is to investigate the results of a multivariate experiment conducted by Instagram. The experiment is designed to measure the relationship between usersâ€™ engagement time and both type and prevalence of the ads. The two way factorial analysis allows us to quantify the interaction effects of multiple types of variables (type and preva- lence) on the response (user engagement time). Therefore, we can estimate which specific types of ads, ad display frequencies or combinations of different types and frequencies reduce or increase the time user spends with the app.
